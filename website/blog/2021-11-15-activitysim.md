Please welcome [ActivitySim](https://activitysim.github.io) to the SimWrapper family!

ActivitySim is an advanced activity-based transport model being co-developed by a consortium of cities and state agencies in the U.S. There is now an ActivitySim flavor of SimWrapper being implemented at <https://activitysim.github.io/dashboard>.

This is just the first phase of this work! If you are interested in ActivitySim and want to help created data visualization tools after the model has finished running, you've found the right place.

More to come!
